This is the official repository of **"FastKV: Decoupling of Context Reduction and KV Cache Compression for Prefill-Decoding Acceleration"**.

* FastKV introduces a novel Token-Selective Propagation (TSP) approach, selectively propagating only critical tokens to layer layers while retaining full-context information in early layers.
* This method significantly reduces KV cache size while maintaining accuracy, leading to improved latency and efficiency in long-context processing of LLMs.
* Experiments results demonstrate that FastKV achieves up to **1.82×** speedup in prefill and **2.87×** speedup in decoding, while maintaining less than 1% accuracy degradation compared to full-context inference on long-context benchmarks
